### How to run

Given that all project modules within this repository are not in production build, you will have to extract the particular repository out from this mono repository and import it into Android Studio. The steps are as follows:

**Steps**
1. Download this mono repo from Github
2. Pull out the particular project repository that you are interested
3. Launch Android Studio
4. Go for **Open an existing Android Studio Project**
5. Locate to the repository that were pulled out
5. Run on an emulator with correct Sdk version

**Caveats**
- I don't recommend you to checkout directly using the Web URL on Android studio. 
- Beware on Gradle dependencies at `builld.gradle`, some of them might be outdated and required new version.
- Project modules for [**Weekly Challenges**](#weekly-challenges:) serve merely as coding playground with the simple implementing features listed on the [gudelines](https://github.com/wnyao/cp3406_mobile_computing/blob/master/weekly_challenges_guideline.md). Only project modules from [**Course Assignments**](#course-assignments:) are considered complete application.
